I'm a current master's student in the University of Arizona Statistics program.  My current research is in ecological statistics and forestry. I enjoy teaching others about statistics, either in a classroom setting or through consulting.  I believe that accuracy and transparency are crucially important to the discipline of statistics, and I use these principles as a guide when I teach others.
